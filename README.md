# Rich Web Applications – Full-Stack Menu Ordering System

A full-stack web application developed as part of the **Rich Web Applications** module.  
The system demonstrates modern web development practices using **Next.js**, **Material UI**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, with role-based functionality for customers and managers.

## Overview

This application simulates a real-world online ordering platform with two user roles:

### 👤 Customer
- Browse a dynamic menu retrieved from MongoDB
- Add and remove items from a shopping cart
- View cart total and place orders
- Logout functionality

### 🛠️ Manager
- Access a dedicated manager dashboard
- View sales statistics (orders, revenue, items sold)
- View sales trends using charts
- Add new menu items
- Remove existing menu items
- Logout functionality

Role-based access ensures customers cannot access manager features.
